When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Generally Always but its more helpful when you are sharing your code with someone else.    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because sometimes you might just want to make changes and test it on the local on the old branch so pulling changes instantly will cause an issue of overwriting.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks is used to clone someones git repository into our own git repository with a reference to their work. Clone is to copy the git repository to our local systems. Branch is to keep a copy of the original commit and branch out into another codeline.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It helps compare and decide that which commits are new and different between the local and github repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Easier would be collaborate in person... Harder would be to collaborate on the same file at the same time and merging changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

Separate branches are better when you have to test a new functionality leaving the original content as it is.
